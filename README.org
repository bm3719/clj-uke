* clj-uke
Quick program to display notes playable on ukulele with a time delay for note
recognition practice.

Quickly made to go from reading tabs to standard notation.  Couldn't find an
existing webapp that did this, so made my own.
** TODO
Some features to add later:
- Add more notes: Keeping it limited to just C5-D6 for now.
- Add flats and sharps.
